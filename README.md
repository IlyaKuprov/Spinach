Spinach is a fast (polynomial complexity scaling for liquid state NMR) open-source 
spin dynamics simulation library that supports NMR, EPR, MRI, DNP, MAS, Optimal Control,
PHIP, singlet state NMR, and other forms of Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy. Historical
notes on its development are published here:
