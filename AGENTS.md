Spinach is a scientific computing package that uses the following areas of physics and mathematics to work: linear algebra, numerical linear algebra, quantum mechanics, Lie algebras, Lie groups, vector and matrix spaces, scientific computing. Spinach is written exclusively in Matlab.

==Wiki documentation files==
There is a documentation Wiki for this project, it is located at https://spindynamics.org/wiki/ web site. The template for how a Wiki page of each function must look like is in kernel/conventions/policies/wiki_template.txt file. If you are asked to create a Wiki file for a particular function in Spinach, use that template file. When making Wiki documentation file, you must include all description and syntax information that is present in the function itself as well as in its documentaton header.
