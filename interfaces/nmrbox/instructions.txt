1. Rename nmrbox_autoexec.m into autoexec.m and move to 
   kernel/includes, overwriting the previous file.

2. Rename nmrbox_activate_spinach.m into activate_spinach.m 
   and move to wherever this file normally resides.

3. Having activated Spinach, run nmrbox_sanity_check.m to 
   make sure that the parallel pool part of your Matlab 
   installation is functional.
