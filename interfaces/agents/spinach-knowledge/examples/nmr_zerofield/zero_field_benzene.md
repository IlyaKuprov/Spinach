# examples/nmr_zerofield/zero_field_benzene.m

- Signature: `zero_field_benzene()`

## Purpose

Zero-field NMR spectroscopy -benzene with one 13C nucleus. Set to reproduce Figure 2 from Calculation time: seconds

## Physical / mathematical content

- Zero- and ultralow-field NMR examples. The main physics is the crossover from Zeeman-dominated spectra to J-dominated spectra, with coherent evolution in near-zero field and detection of low-frequency transitions.
- Signal processing is central here: the code moves between time and frequency domains, typically using FFT conventions, apodisation, zero filling, or heterodyne frequency shifts.

## Numerical / algorithmic content

- The output is processed in the Fourier domain, implying standard NMR/ESR signal-processing considerations such as acquisition bandwidth, zero filling, phase, and apodisation.
