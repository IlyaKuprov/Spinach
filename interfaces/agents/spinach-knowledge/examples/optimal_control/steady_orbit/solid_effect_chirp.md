- Signature: `solid_effect_chirp()`

## Purpose

Panoramic optimisation for stroboscopic steady state DNP with the timing and power settings matching the XiX ex- eriment, but complete liberty is the choice of phase.

## Physical / mathematical content

- Optimal-control examples. These scripts formulate pulse design as a nonlinear optimisation problem over waveform samples or basis coefficients. The core mathematical objects are fidelities, gradients, Hessians or Hessian approximations, ensemble robustness objectives, and constrained search over RF amplitude/phase trajectories.
- The numerical method is quasi-Newton optimisation: curvature information is approximated from successive step and gradient differences instead of forming exact second derivatives every iteration.
- The optimisation logic is Newton or Newton-like: search directions use first- and second-order local curvature information, usually with regularisation or line-search safeguards.
- The control theory content is GRAPE: fidelity derivatives are propagated through a piecewise-constant pulse sequence so that waveform samples can be improved by gradient-based optimisation.

## Numerical / algorithmic content

- The file is built around the standard Spinach workflow: create the spin system, choose a basis or context, assemble operators/superoperators, then propagate or analyse the resulting dynamics.
