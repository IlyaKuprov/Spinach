% Uhrig's UDD decoupling sequence timings. Syntax:
%
%               time_delays=uhrig_times(T,N)
%
% Parameters:
%
%    T - total duration of the sequence (sum of all delays)
%
%    N - number of pulses in the sequence
%
% Outputs:
%
%    time_delays - list of delays between ideal pulses in
%                  the UDD sequence; the first pulse goes 
%                  after the first delay, and there is a 
%                  delay after the last pulse

function time_delays=uhrig_times(T,N)

% Check consistency
grumble(T,N);

% Use the formula from WSW's 2009 JCP paper
time_positions=T*(sin(pi*(1:N)/(2*N+2)).^2-0.5);

% Convert positions to delays
time_delays=diff(time_positions);

% Add the starting and the trailing delay
chunk=(T-sum(time_delays))/2;
time_delays=[chunk time_delays chunk];

end

% Consistency enforcement
