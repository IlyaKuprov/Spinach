- Source: `/home/kuprov/.openclaw/workspace/Spinach/experiments/bruker/hsqcetgpsi.m`
- Signature: `fid=hsqcetgpsi(spin_system,parameters,H,R,K)`
- Total lines: 294

## Purpose

Sensitivity-improved echo/antiecho gradient-selected HSQC pulse sequence, based on the Bruker hsqcetgpsi pulse program and the standard HSQC sequence from: The gradient selection is represented analytically by coherence order selection statements

## Physical / mathematical content

- This file belongs to the `experiments` part of Spinach. Its role should be read together with nearby files in the same directory, which usually share a common physical regime or infrastructure purpose.

## Numerical / algorithmic content

- Time propagation is explicit. In Spinach this usually means repeated application of matrix exponentials or propagator factorizations to density operators or state vectors in Hilbert/Liouville/Fokker-Planck space.
- The file contains an explicit `grumble(...)` validator, which is Spinach convention for front-loading dimension, type, and regime checks before expensive linear-algebra work begins.
- The file also defines local helper function(s): `grumble()`. This usually means the public entry point is supported by tightly coupled validation or helper logic kept private to the file.

## Syntax

```matlab
fid=hsqcetgpsi(spin_system,parameters,H,R,K)
```

## Parameters / inputs

- parameters.sweep [F1 F2] sweep widths, Hz
- parameters.npoints [F1 F2] numbers of points
- parameters.spins {F1 F2} nuclei (e.g. '13C','1H')
- parameters.decouple_f2 nuclei to decouple in F2, e.g.

## Outputs

- fid.pos,fid.neg -echo and antiecho components of the
- signal.
- Note: natural abundance simulations should make use of the isotope
- dilution functionality. See dilute.m function.
