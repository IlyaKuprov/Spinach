## Purpose

Four-pulse DEER/PELDOR pulse sequence. The sequence uses soft pulses computed with the Fokker-Planck formalism. Syntax: echo_stack=deer_4p_soft_deer(spin_system,parameters,H,R,K)

## Physical / mathematical content

- Dipolar ESR experiment implementations. The pulse logic resolves dipolar couplings by echo modulation, with selective excitation and time-domain accumulation.
- The file uses a Fokker-Planck-style enlarged state space in which spatial or orientational coordinates are promoted to extra dimensions and coupled to spin dynamics through differential operators.
- Propagation is accelerated with a Krylov-subspace method, replacing direct matrix exponentiation by projection into a much smaller Arnoldi/Lanczos-type subspace.
- Signal processing is central here: the code moves between time and frequency domains, typically using FFT conventions, apodisation, zero filling, or heterodyne frequency shifts.
- The spin physics includes through-space magnetic dipole-dipole coupling, a rank-2 anisotropic interaction with strong orientation dependence and characteristic secular/non-secular structure.

## Numerical / algorithmic content

- Time propagation is explicit. In Spinach this usually means repeated application of matrix exponentials or propagator factorizations to density operators or state vectors in Hilbert/Liouville/Fokker-Planck space.
- A Krylov-subspace or Arnoldi construction is used to avoid forming or exponentiating very large dense propagators directly.
- The file contains an explicit `grumble(...)` validator, which is Spinach convention for front-loading dimension, type, and regime checks before expensive linear-algebra work begins.
- The file also defines local helper function(s): `grumble()`. This usually means the public entry point is supported by tightly coupled validation or helper logic kept private to the file.

## Outputs

- echo_stack -DEER echo stack, a matrix with p3_nsteps echoes
- with echo_npts points each
- Note: for the method, start with 'expm', change to 'expv' if the
- calculation runs out of memory, and use 'evolution' as the
- last resort.
- Note: simulated echoes tend to be sharp and hard to catch becau-
- se simulation does not have distributions in experimental
- parameters. Fourier transforming the echo prior to integ-
- ration is recommended.
- Note: the time in the DEER trace refers to the third pulse inser-
- tion point, after end of the second pulse.
