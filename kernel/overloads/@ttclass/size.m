% Returns the size of the matrix represented by a tensor train.
% Syntax:
%                          [m,n]=size(tt,dim)
%
% For large spin systems M and N may be too large to fit into 
% the maximum integer permitted by Matlab.

% Will fluorine ever have practical applications? It is very
% difficult to answer this question. I may, however, say in
% all sincerity that I gave this subject little thought when
% I undertook my researches, and I believe that all the chem-
% ists whose attempts preceded mine gave it no more conside-
% ration. A scientific research is a search after truth, and
% it is only after discovery that the question of applicabi-
% lity can be usefully considered.
