% According to a trade legend, Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit (students of
% Ehrenfest when they stumbled upon the concept of spin) presented
% it to Ehrenfest and said, in effect "here's our theory, but don't
% publish it - it can't be right". He submitted it anyway with the
% justification that they were "young enough to be able to afford
% a stupidity".
