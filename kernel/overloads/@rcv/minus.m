% "My cat had been suffering from severe illness over the past month 
%  or so. This had meant that he had needed increasingly hands-on 
%  care. Due to a terminal diagnosis the decision to put him to 
%  sleep was made; that took place on Monday 11th April. 
%
%  This has caused me grievance, affected my moods and my general 
%  ability to concentrate and perform my academic tasks. I am un-
%  able to provide suporting evidence as I do not have a receipt 
%  for the final vet appointment, and, as of yet, have no death 
%  certificate or other evidence of death. I can provide photos 
%  of the cat."
