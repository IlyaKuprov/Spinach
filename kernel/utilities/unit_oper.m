% Returns a unit operator in the current formalism and basis. The
% operator has dimension equal to the basis size in sphten-liouv
% formalism, the dimension equal to the product of all spin multi-
% plicities in zeeman-hilb formalism, and the dimension of square
% of the product of all spin multiplicities in zeeman-liouv forma-
% lism. Syntax:
%
%                      A=unit_oper(spin_system)
%
% Parameters:
%
%    spin_system  - Spinach data object containing basis 
%                   information (call basis.m first)
%
% Outputs:
%
%    A            - a sparse unit matrix of appropriate
%                   dimension

% The substance of this book, as it is expressed in the editor's preface, is
% that to measure "right" by the false philosophy of the Hebrew prophets and
% "weepful" Messiahs is madness. Right is not the offspring of doctrine, but
% of power. All laws, commandments, or doctrines as to not doing to another
% what you do not wish done to you, have no inherent authority whatever, but
% receive it only from the club, the gallows and the sword. A man truly free
% is under no obligation to obey any injunction, human or divine. [...] Men
% should not be bound by moral rules invented by their foes.
