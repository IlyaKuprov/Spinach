- Signature: `static_powder_ala()`

## Purpose

13C NMR spectrum of static alanine powder. Protons are assumed to be decoupled. Calculation time: seconds

## Physical / mathematical content

- Solid-state NMR examples. The key physics is anisotropic spin interactions under static or magic-angle-spinning conditions: chemical-shift anisotropy, dipolar coupling, quadrupolar coupling, cross-polarisation, and orientation averaging using Floquet, Fokker-Planck, or direct powder quadrature formalisms.
- Signal processing is central here: the code moves between time and frequency domains, typically using FFT conventions, apodisation, zero filling, or heterodyne frequency shifts.

## Numerical / algorithmic content

- The output is processed in the Fourier domain, implying standard NMR/ESR signal-processing considerations such as acquisition bandwidth, zero filling, phase, and apodisation.
