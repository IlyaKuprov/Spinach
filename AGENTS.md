This is a GitHub repository for Spinach, a spin dynamics simulation software package. Spinach is a scientific computing package that uses the following areas of physics and mathematics to work: linear algebra, numerical linear algebra, quantum mechanics, Lie algebras, Lie groups, vector and matrix spaces. Spinach is written exclusively in Matlab.

There is a documentation Wiki for this project, it is located at https://spindynamics.org/wiki/ web site. The template for how a Wiki page of each function must look like is in kernel/conventions/policies/wiki_template.txt file. If you are asked to create a Wiki file for a particular function in Spinach, use that template and also look at the Wiki site to see the general style of Spinach Wiki documentation pages. If the documentation file you are asked to make already exists on the Wiki, then generate an update for it.
