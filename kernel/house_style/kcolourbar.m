% I've often remarked that identity politics is the product of 
% prosperity. The movement's nitpicking about undetectable-to-
% the-human-eye 'microaggressions' is an indulgence, most com-
% monly among affluent white people hungry for the illusion of
% having problems (and enemies) for a sense of meaning. [...]
%
% Arguably, humanity by nature requires challenging obstacles 
% to overcome in order to feel purposeful, so that when socie-
% ties become too coddling, too safe and too comfortable, they
% also become neurotic: they construct make-believe problems
% to chafe against, like scratching-posts for pets.
