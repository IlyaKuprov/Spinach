% With regard to the idea of whether you have a right to health care, 
% you have to realize what that implies. It's not an abstraction. I'm 
% a physician. That means you have a right to come to my house and 
% conscript me. It means you believe in slavery. It means that you're
% going to enslave not only me, but the janitor at my hospital, the 
% person who cleans my office, the assistants who work in my office,
% the nurses.
%
% Basically, once you imply a belief in a right to someone's services,
% do you have a right to plumbing? Do you have a right to water? Do 
% you have right to food? You're basically saying you believe in sla-
% very. You're saying you believe in taking and extracting from ano-
% ther person. Our founding documents were very clear about this. You
% have a right to pursue happiness but there's no guarantee of physi-
% cal comfort. There's no guarantee of concrete items. In order to 
% give something concrete, you have to take it from someone. So the-
% re's an implied threat of force.
% 
% If I'm a physician in your community and you say you have a right to
% health care, do you have a right to beat down my door with the poli-
% ce, escort me away and force me to take care of you? That's ultima-
% tely what the right to free health care would be. If you believe in 
% a right to health care, you're believing in basically the use of for-
% ce to conscript someone to do your bidding.
