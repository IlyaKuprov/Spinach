- Signature: `fid=hncoca(spin_system,parameters,H,R,K)`

## Purpose

Phase-sensitive HN(CO)CA pulse sequence from using the bidirectional propagation method described in The sequence is hard-wired to work on 1H,13C,15N proteins and uses PDB labels to select spins that will be affected by otherwise ideal pulses. F1 is N, F2 is CA, F3 is H. Syntax: fid=hncoca(spin_system,parameters,H,R,K)

## Physical / mathematical content

- Protein triple-resonance sequence implementations. They orchestrate heteronuclear coherence transfers across biomolecular spin networks while preserving phase and acquisition conventions.
- Orientation or trajectory averaging is performed numerically, so grid design, weights, and integration error control matter directly to accuracy and runtime.

## Numerical / algorithmic content

- Time propagation is explicit. In Spinach this usually means repeated application of matrix exponentials or propagator factorizations to density operators or state vectors in Hilbert/Liouville/Fokker-Planck space.
- Numerical integration over angles or geometry is part of the implementation, so point placement and weights are as important as the local Hamiltonian calculations.

## Parameters / inputs

- parameters.npoints -a vector of three integers giving the
- number of points in the three temporal
- dimensions, ordered as [t1 t2 t3].
- parameters.sweep -a vector of three real numbers giving
- the sweep widths in the three frequen-
- cy dimensions, ordered as [f1 f2 f3].
- parameters.tau -the four delays required for the ope-
- ration of the sequence (see the paper)
- in seconds. Reasonable values are
- [2.25e-3, 2.75e-3, 8.00e-3, 7.00e-3]
- H -Hamiltonian matrix, received from context function
- R -relaxation superoperator, received from context function
- K -kinetics superoperator, received from context function

## Outputs

- fid -a structure with four fields: fid.pos_pos, fid.pos_neg,
- fid.neg_pos, fid.neg_neg that are used in the subsequ-
- ent States quadrature processing
- Note: spin labels must be set to PDB atom IDs ('CA', 'HA', etc.) in
- sys.labels for this sequence to work properly.
