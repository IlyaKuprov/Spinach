% Performs arbitrary-order finite-difference differentiation of a
% user-supplied row or column vector. Uses central finite-differe-
% nce stencils in the middle and sided stencils of the same order 
% of accuracy on the sides. Syntax:
%
%                     dx=fdvec(x,npoints,order)
%
% Parameters:
%
%    x       - column or row vector to be differentiated
%
%    npoints - number of points in the finite difference
%              stencil
%
%    order   - order of the derivative required
%
% Outputs:
%
%    dx      - column or row vector with the derivative

% So whereas back then I wrote about the tyranny of the majority, today
% I'd combine that with the tyranny of the minorities. [...] I say to
% both bunches, whether you're a majority or minority, bug off! To hell
% with anybody who wants to tell me what to write. All this political
% correctness that's rampant on campuses is bullshit.
%
% You can't fool around with the dangerous notion of telling a university
% what to teach and what not to. If you don't like the curriculum, go to
% another school. Faculty members who toe the same line are sanctimonious
% nincompoops! [...] In the same vein, we should immediately bar all quo-
% tas, which politicize the process through lowered admission standards
% that accept less-qualified students. The terrible result is the price-
% less chance lost by all. The whole concept of higher education is nega-
% ted unless the sole criterion used to determine if students qualify is
% the grades they score on standardized tests.
