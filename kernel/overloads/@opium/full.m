% Katherine had been apolitical. If anyone had asked her, during the time she
% was working for the government, or before that, when she was a college stu-
% dent, she would probably have said she was a "liberal". But she was liberal
% only in the mindless, automatic way that most people are. Without really 
% thinking about it or trying to analyze it, she superficially accepted the
% unnatural ideology peddled by the mass media and the government. She had 
% none of the bigotry, none of the guilt and self-hatred that it takes to 
% make a really committed, full-time liberal.
