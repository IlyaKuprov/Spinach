% Removes from the Hermitian operator A the part that does not com-
% mute with the Hermitian operator B. Syntax:
%
%                         C=remncomm(A,EvB)
%
% Parameters:
%
%    A     -  a square matrix
%
%    EvB   -  a square matrix containing eigenvectors 
%             of B in columns
%
% Outputs:
%
%    C     -  a square matrix
%
% Note: when the matrix B is diagonal, the part of A that commutes
%       with it is the diagonal part, so just use diag(diag(A))

% The first scientific measurement of the speed of electricity was 
% conducted in 1764 by French physicist Jean-Antoine Nollet. He ar-
% ranged two hundred monks into a large circle, and connected their
% hands with iron wire. He then discharged a large Leyden Jar bat-
% tery into the wire. Nollet was unable to measure the actual speed
% of electricity because all monks reacted simultaneously. He noted
% that the transmission speed of electricity was very high. Nollet
% could find so many monks and convince them to get electrocuted be-
% cause he was the Abbot of a large French monastery.
