## Purpose

Phase-sensitive COSY pulse sequence from:

## Physical / mathematical content

- Liquid-state pulse sequence implementations. These are production experiment kernels that carry out coherence transfer, mixing, refocusing, decoupling, and indirect evolution on precomputed Hamiltonian/relaxation/kinetics operators.

## Numerical / algorithmic content

- Time propagation is explicit. In Spinach this usually means repeated application of matrix exponentials or propagator factorizations to density operators or state vectors in Hilbert/Liouville/Fokker-Planck space.
- The file contains an explicit `grumble(...)` validator, which is Spinach convention for front-loading dimension, type, and regime checks before expensive linear-algebra work begins.
- The file also defines local helper function(s): `grumble()`. This usually means the public entry point is supported by tightly coupled validation or helper logic kept private to the file.

## Syntax

```matlab
fid=cosy(spin_system,parameters,H,R,K)
```

## Parameters / inputs

- parameters.sweep sweep width in Hz
- parameters.npoints number of points for both dimensions
- parameters.spins nuclei on which the sequence runs,
- specified as {'1H'}, {'13C'}, etc.
- parameters.angle second pulse angle in radians, usu-
- ally pi/2, but also allows COSY45,
- COSY60, etc.
- H -Hamiltonian matrix, received from context function
- R -relaxation superoperator, received from context function
- K -kinetics superoperator, received from context function

## Outputs

- fid -two-dimensional free induction decay
- Note: if the second pulse angle differs from 90 degrees, magni-
- tude mode plotting is advised.
- Note: the implementation analytically retains the +1 t1 coher-
- ence order, corresponding to a single phase-sensitive
- pathway.
